#Ember-Brunch-Demo

This is a simple demo for working with Brunch, Ember.js and Handlebars.

##Usage

Clone the repo and run `npm install` & `brunch build`.

Once the project has been created, you can start a server by running

    brunch watch --server

then visit `localhost:3333`

To deploy this project to heroku. First setup heroku on your local machine. See more info on the [official site](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs).

Once heroku is setup, create the app on heroku `heroku create 'your app name'` and push the project up to heroku by `git push origin master`.
